# Today I Learned: Hugo Static Site Generator 🚀

Today marks the beginning of my daily learning journey, and what better way to start than by learning the very tool I'm using to build this blog!

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go that's blazingly fast. It takes your content written in Markdown and transforms it into a complete website using templates and themes.

### Key Things I Discovered:

**⚡ Speed**: Hugo builds sites incredibly fast - we're talking milliseconds for most sites. Perfect for that instant feedback loop when developing.

**📁 Simple Structure**: 
```
content/     # Your markdown files
themes/      # Themes directory  
hugo.toml    # Configuration file
public/      # Generated static site
```

**🎨 Themes**: The ecosystem has amazing themes like the `loficode` theme I'm using - it even has ambient sounds for that cozy coding vibe!

## Commands I Learned Today

```bash
# Create a new site
hugo new site my-blog

# Create a new post
hugo new posts/my-post.md

# Start development server
hugo server -D

# Build the site
hugo
```

## The "Aha!" Moments

1. **Front Matter Magic**: The `+++` sections at the top of posts control everything - dates, tags, whether it's a draft, etc.

2. **Live Reload**: Save a file and instantly see changes in the browser. No build step needed during development!

3. **Theme Configuration**: The `hugo.toml` file is where all the magic happens - profile info, social links, site behavior.

## What Surprised Me

The learning curve was gentler than expected. Within an hour, I had a functioning blog with a beautiful theme, ambient sounds, and all my content organized.

## Tomorrow's Goal

I want to dive deeper into Hugo's templating system and maybe customize some aspects of my theme. Also planning to set up automated deployment!
